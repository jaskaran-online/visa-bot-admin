# Project Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented the Visa Bot Admin dashboard with integration to the AutoMationBOT API. The dashboard provides a user interface for managing visa appointment bots and viewing appointments.

## Implementation Details

### API Integration

- Integrated with the AutoMationBOT API based on the OpenAPI specification
- Created dedicated API handlers for each module (bots, appointments, logs, etc.)
- Implemented proper error handling and API request/response processing
- Added environment variable configuration for API URL and authentication

### Bot Management Module

- Bot listing with filtering capabilities
- Bot detail view with real-time status updates
- Bot log viewer with filtering and export functionality
- Bot creation form with validation
- Bot control actions (start, stop, restart, delete)

### Appointment Management Module

- Appointment listing with filtering and search
- Appointment detail view with comprehensive information
- Appointment status management (confirm, cancel)
- CSV export functionality for appointments

### Other Features

- Responsive UI for both desktop and mobile devices
- Consistent error handling and user feedback
- Modular code organization for maintainability
- Helper script for common development tasks

## Git Structure

We've established a Git workflow with the following branches:

- `develop`: Main development branch
- `feature/api-integration`: API client implementation
- `feature/bot-management`: Bot management features
- `feature/appointments`: Appointment management features

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure `.env.local` with API settings
3. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
4. Start development server with `pnpm dev`

Alternatively, use the helper script:
```
./run.sh setup
./run.sh dev
```
