## Log Viewer Update Summary

We've updated the log viewing system to use polling instead of Server-Sent Events (SSE) for better compatibility and reliability. Here's a summary of the changes:

### Polling Log Viewer

1. **Created a new `PollingLogViewer` component:**
   - Implements a 30-second polling interval to regularly fetch logs
   - Displays logs in reverse chronological order (newest first)
   - Includes toggle for auto-refresh
   - Provides manual refresh button
   - Supports log export and clear functionality
   - Shows status indicators for polling state and last update time

2. **Updated Bot Logs Component:**
   - Replaced the old implementation with the new `PollingLogViewer`
   - Simplified the component by delegating log fetching and display to the new viewer
   - Maintained search and filter functionality

3. **Updated System Logs Page:**
   - Replaced the SSE-based `RealTimeLogViewer` with the polling-based version
   - Added special handling for general system logs
   - Improved error handling

4. **Updated Bot API Handler:**
   - Modified `getBotLogs` function to handle both bot-specific and general logs
   - Added support for different log limits
   - Improved error handling and logging

### Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Better Compatibility:**
   - Works in environments where SSE connections might be blocked or unsupported
   - More reliable in environments with network constraints

2. **User Experience Improvements:**
   - Shows newest logs first (reverse chronological order)
   - Provides clear visibility of when logs were last updated
   - Allows users to toggle auto-refresh on/off
   - Shows connection status visually

3. **Reduced Server Load:**
   - Polling at 30-second intervals instead of maintaining constant connections
   - More efficient for systems with many simultaneous users

4. **Simplified Implementation:**
   - The code is more maintainable and easier to understand
   - Better error handling
   - More consistent with the rest of the application

This update ensures that the log viewing system works reliably across different environments and network conditions, while providing a better user experience.
